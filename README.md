# Vuln Hub — INF601 Practice Pentest Target

A small, intentionally vulnerable Flask web app. It is the **authorized target**
for **Mini Project 4 (Cybersecurity track)**. It contains **6 planted
vulnerabilities**; each one hides a unique `FLAG{...}` you can only read by
actually exploiting the bug.

> ⚠️ **This software is deliberately insecure.** Run it only on your own machine
> or an isolated lab network. **Never** put it on the public internet. Test
> **only this app** — nothing else is in scope.

## Run it

### Your seed

`FLAG_SEED` is **your FHSU username**, lowercase, without `@fhsu.edu`
(e.g. `jdoe`). It determines your flags. The app lowercases it and ignores any `@fhsu.edu`, so `JDoe` or `jdoe@fhsu.edu` work too. Set it in your shell first:

```bash
export FLAG_SEED=jdoe            # bash / zsh (macOS, Linux)
```

```powershell
$env:FLAG_SEED="jdoe"            # Windows PowerShell
```

If you forget: `docker compose` refuses to start and tells you to set `FLAG_SEED`. With `python app.py` or `docker run`, the app starts anyway but prints a warning, shows a red "DEFAULT seed" banner on every page, and uses a default seed whose flags are NOT valid for your username.

### Option A — Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
# or, plain docker:
docker build -t inf601-vulnhub .
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 -e FLAG_SEED=jdoe inf601-vulnhub
```

### Option B — Python venv

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py                    # uses the FLAG_SEED you set above
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:5000>. A public test account is
`alice / password123` (you need a normal session for some challenges).

> **macOS:** port 5000 is often taken by AirPlay Receiver. Use another port:
> `PORT=5001 python app.py`, or `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5001:5000 -e FLAG_SEED=jdoe inf601-vulnhub`,
> then open <http://127.0.0.1:5001>.

> The flags also exist as plain files and database rows on your own machine, so
> finding them that way proves nothing. **Only flags whose exploit appears in
> your PoC earn credit.**

## The 6 challenges

Each is a different, common web vulnerability. Start at the home page — it has a
short hint for each.

1. **SQL injection** — bypass the login form.
2. **IDOR** — read a message that isn't yours.
3. **Stored XSS** — steal the admin's cookie via the guestbook.
4. **Broken authorization** — reach `/vault` (superadmins only).
5. **Path traversal** — make the `/download` endpoint serve a file it shouldn't.
6. **Sensitive data exposure** — find a file that was left exposed (start with `/robots.txt`).

You are encouraged to **drive the exploration with Claude Code** — that is the
point of the project. Capture each `FLAG{...}` you find.

---

## What to submit (per the MP4 rubric)

A GitHub repo named `miniproject4YourFullName` containing:

1. **`submission.txt`** — each captured flag on its own line.
2. A **Proof-of-Concept** for each finding (the exact request / payload /
   command / screenshot that captured the flag).
3. A **pentest report** (Markdown or PDF) with, for each finding: the
   vulnerability class, severity, how you found and exploited it, evidence, and
   **remediation** advice. Include a scope + **authorization statement** at the top.
4. A **README** with an **`## AI Usage`** section (what Claude Code did vs. what
   you did — you must be able to explain every step at the Week 16 review).

### Check your flags

```bash
python check_flags.py submission.txt --username jdoe
```

This prints `VALID` / `NOT VALID` for each line. It awards no points: each
flag counts only if your report's PoC shows the exploit that produced it.

## Scope & ethics

Testing systems you are not authorized to test is an academic-honesty and
conduct violation. **Only** this app, running on **your** machine, is in scope.
Put a short authorization/ethics statement at the top of your report.





## AI Usage

I used ChatGPT as an AI assistant during this project. It helped me understand the challenge hints, explain commands and testing steps, troubleshoot issues, understand the vulnerabilities and the application behavior, and organize and review my penetration test report and documentation.

### Claude Code

I launched Claude Code from the project directory using the `claude` command. I used it to help review and understand the provided Vuln Hub project, including the application structure and the purpose of the vulnerabilities.


### My Work

I personally ran the Vuln Hub application on my local machine, performed the testing steps, entered the commands and payloads, captured the evidence screenshots, collected the flags, and validated all six flags using `check_flags.py`.

The six vulnerabilities I tested were:

1. SQL Injection
2. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
3. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
4. Broken Authorization
5. Path Traversal
6. Sensitive Data Exposure

I reviewed the results of each test and documented the proof of concept, impact, evidence, and remediation in `pentest_report.md`. I also maintained `submission.txt` with the captured flags and used Git commits to document my progress.
